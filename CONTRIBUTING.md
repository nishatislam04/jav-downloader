# Contributing to UAV Downloader

Thank you for improving the project. Bug reports that include a reproducible
URL and precise application version are especially valuable because supported
sites and CDNs can change independently of the application.

## Development setup

Use Python 3.10 or newer; release builds use Python 3.12.10.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nishatislam04/jav-downloader.git
cd jav-downloader
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv\Scripts\python -m pip install -e .
.venv\Scripts\python -m pytest tests -q
```

On macOS or Linux, activate the virtual environment with
`source .venv/bin/activate` and install Tk through the operating system when it
is not bundled with Python.

## Pull requests

- Keep site-specific parsing in `src/uav_downloader/sites`.
- Put shared configuration, network, update, and migration behavior in `core`.
- Add regression tests for crawler changes and user-visible bug fixes.
- Preserve public CLI options, state migration, and v2 release aliases unless
  a documented major-version decision explicitly replaces them.
- Never commit API keys, cookies, proxy credentials, downloaded videos, model
  packs, or personally identifying logs.
- Run the full test suite before requesting review.

Windows executable releases are created only by the pinned GitHub Actions
workflow. Do not attach locally built executables to project releases.
