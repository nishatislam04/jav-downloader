## Optional local Japanese speech-recognition pack

The optional `JAV_reazonspeech_asr_v1.zip` archive is a mixed-license,
CPU-only Japanese speech-recognition pack. It contains only the pinned model
and Windows runtime files used by JAV Downloader:

| Component | Immutable source revision | License |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `reazon-research/reazonspeech-k2-v2` | `291488c8151be24d7da4bf7af26e533fad96e407` | Apache License 2.0 |
| `k2-fsa/sherpa-onnx` v1.13.4 | `142807252687d81b40d6315f23470a1512a00de3` | Apache License 2.0 |

The ReazonSpeech checkpoint uses an INT8 encoder and joiner with an FP32
decoder. This project repackages the upstream checkpoint and runtime; it does
not train or fine-tune them. The pack's `manifest.json` records the mixed
licensing, source revisions, original sherpa-onnx release-archive hash, and
the size and SHA-256 of every extracted file.

`model/MODEL_CARD.md` is the exact `README.md` fetched from the immutable
ReazonSpeech revision linked above. It is not sourced from a separately
packaged model archive; its pinned URL, size, and SHA-256 are recorded and
verified independently.

The complete notices are included inside the optional archive:

- `licenses/Apache-2.0.txt` covers the ReazonSpeech model and sherpa-onnx.
- `licenses/ONNXRuntime-MIT.txt` contains the ONNX Runtime MIT license.
- `licenses/ONNXRuntime-ThirdPartyNotices.txt` contains ONNX Runtime's complete
  third-party notices from the pinned version.

The speech-recognition pack is an optional download and is not part of the
source archive. Its components remain subject to their respective licenses and
model-card terms. JAV Downloader fetches the fixed v3.1.0 component on demand;
the same immutable pack is not duplicated in each application release.

## Optional local subtitle-translation model pack

The optional `JAV_local_translation_v1.zip` archive contains converted,
quantized copies of the following third-party model checkpoints:

| Component | Immutable source revision | License |

| `Helsinki-NLP/opus-mt-en-zh` | `408d9bc410a388e1d9aef112a2daba955b945255` | Apache License 2.0 |

The checkpoints are converted to the CTranslate2 format and weight-quantized
to INT8. They are not fine-tuned or otherwise trained by this project. The
archive preserves each upstream model card, includes the Apache License 2.0
text plus the FuguMT creator/source/change notice and CC BY-SA 4.0 legal-code
links, and records source revisions and per-file SHA-256 hashes in
`manifest.json`. The converted FuguMT model files remain under CC BY-SA 4.0;
the OPUS-MT model remains under Apache 2.0.

CTranslate2 is an MIT-licensed conversion and inference runtime:
<https://github.com/OpenNMT/CTranslate2>.

SentencePiece is an Apache-2.0-licensed tokenizer runtime:
<https://github.com/google/sentencepiece>.

OpenCC and the bundled pure-Python `opencc-python-reimplemented` distribution
are Apache-2.0 licensed:
<https://github.com/BYVoid/OpenCC> and
<https://github.com/yichen0831/opencc-python>.

The bundled CTranslate2 Windows runtime includes Intel OpenMP
`libiomp5md.dll`. Intel permits redistribution of the relevant oneAPI runtime
components under the Intel Simplified Software License. The executable bundles
the complete applicable notice and terms at
`third_party_licenses/Intel-Simplified-Software-License.txt`. The Windows
release workflow disables UPX for all collected binaries. In particular,
`libiomp5md.dll` is redistributed without UPX transformation.

JAV Downloader fetches this fixed v3.1.0 translation component on demand. The
same immutable pack is not duplicated in each application release.

Windows executables are packaged with PyInstaller 6.13.0. The release workflow
builds its bootloader from the corresponding source distribution. PyInstaller
is licensed under GPL-2.0-or-later with a bootloader exception:
<https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller/blob/v6.13.0/COPYING.txt>.

CTranslate2 imports NumPy and PyYAML at runtime. The Windows executable pins
and bundles NumPy 2.5.1 under its BSD-3-Clause license and PyYAML 6.0.3 under
its MIT license. NumPy's wheel metadata, including the notices for its bundled
OpenBLAS/LAPACK/GCC runtime components, and PyYAML's license metadata are
included intact in the executable.
